# ❄️ Snow2Code

Hey. I'm Snowy — a quiet, tech-loving arctic fox with a soft heart and a thing for fluffy tails.

- 💻 I tinker with code, themes, setups, and anything I can customize
- 🦊 Arctic fox fursona. Shy, snow-white, and absolutely me
- 🌈 Pansexual. Aroace. Non-binary. Also a furry — deal with it
- 🪟 Windows user. No Linux. I like things simple (but not *that* simple)
- 🦊 I love foxes. They’re just the best. That’s not up for debate.

## 🔧 Tech I Use
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and sometimes SourcePawn when I'm okay with suffering
- **Tools:** Git, VSCode, Node.js, and other nonsense that gets the job done
- **Style:** Clean code, cozy UI, no terminal wizardry unless I have to

## 🔗 Find Me
- 📁 Repos: Scroll down. Some are in my orgs too — I bounce around a bit
- 🧊 Setups and themes: Yes, I overthink colors. Yes, it’s worth it
- 🦊 Fursona: Snowy. Arctic fox. Me, but fluffier
