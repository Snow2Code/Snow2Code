# ❄️ Snow2Code

Hey. I'm Snowy — a soft-spoken dev who prefers calm over chaos.

- 🧊 I mess with code, tools, themes, and small experiments
- 🦊 Arctic fox fursona. Quiet, fluffy, and a little shy — just like me
- 🌈 Pansexual. Aroace. Non-binary. And yes, I'm a furry.
- 🛠️ I build when I'm bored and tinker when I shouldn't

## 🔧 Tech I Touch
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, maybe a bit of Sourcepawn when I feel like pain
- **Tools:** Git, VSCode, Node.js, whatever else I break along the way
- **Vibes:** Terminal themes, CSS hell, bash aliases I forget about

## 🔗 Find Me
- 📂 Repos: Scroll down. They're chaotic, but they're mine. Can check my organiations for them to.
- 🐾 Furry trash: Confirmed. Digital fursona TBD.
- ✨ Custom setups, themes, tweaks: Sometimes pretty. Usually overly complicated.
